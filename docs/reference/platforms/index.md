# Platforms which perform SRM checks natively

Several experimentation platforms natively perform Sample Ratio Mismatch checks for their users. These platforms will not be supported by our Chrome Extension, because that would be redundant.

If there is a platform missing from this list, please let us know [on Github](https://github.com/lukasvermeer/srm/issues). Thanks!
