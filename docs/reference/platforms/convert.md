As of December 2021, [Convert](https://www.convert.com) has introduced their own Sample Ratio Mismatch warnings. In April 2022, these warnings were [announced](https://www.convert.com/blog/a-b-testing/sample-ratio-mismatch-srm-guide/). These warnings are currently optional and must be enabled by users in the settings.
