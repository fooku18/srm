# Conductrics

Optional SRM Checks
{: .label .label-green }

[Conductrics](https://conductrics.com) allows users to set up a Notifications Stream with 'potential issues with agent data collection' which can be sent to multiple endpoints (chat, email, etc.). These notifications will include Sample Ratio Mismatch warnings, as well as warnings for overly low or high session counts or goals counts.
